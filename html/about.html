            <p> hi, i'm tyler. you probably already know that by now.</p>
            <p> i'm not a big fan of giving out personal info online, but this wouldn't be a good about page if i didn't give some basic information, so: </p>
            <p> -   i'm 17 </p>
            <p> -   i'm nonbinary (pronouns are they/them) </p>
            <p> -   i live somewhere in australia
            <p> that's as much as i'm willing to share. </p>
            <p> in terms of less important things (hobbies and stuff), i'm intersted in computer stuff (mainly cybersec, networking, sysadmin, etc.) and i'm currently undertaking formal education for them </p>
            <p> linux is my autism special interest and like 1 of 2 things im actually fully passionate about. i use gentoo because its the best distro (me when im delusional) </p>
            <p> i play bass and piano. i mainly play jazz stuff in my free time (weather report my beloved), but i play bass in a punk band aswell. </p>
            <p> i own somewhere between 2 - 4 ikea bl√•haj plushies </p>
            <p> i'm not a particually interesting person, so thats all i can really write about myself. </p>

        <div class="contentbox">
            <h4> contact </h4>
